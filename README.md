# Films-Visualization

This program aims to provide clear visualizations of the database. 
The best way to visualize would be through different types of graph.

The csv file I created attracts top 100 films of all time, and they are 
categorized via rating, year of release, and the overall gross earning. 

More info about the csv file can be found on IDMb.com. 

For testing, simply do python3 'name of the file'.py. Then the terminal or console
will generated .png files, serve as visualizations.
