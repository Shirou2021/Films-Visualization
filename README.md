# Films-Visualization

This program aims to provide clear visualizations of the database via line plot, 
heatmap, and bar graph. Furthermore, it will also serves as an intro practice for 
data visualizations/analysis. 

The csv file I created attracted top 100 films of all time, and they are 
categorized via rating, year of release, and the overall gross earning. 

More info about the csv file can be found on IDMb.com. 

For testing, simply do python3 'name of the file'.py. Then the terminal or console
will generated .png files, serve as visualizations.

A quick side note: Due to the size of dataset is relatively small compared to others, 
hence the pictures that are going to be generated might not look too fancy/good.
